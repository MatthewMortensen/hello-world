# Where to find Matthew Mortensen Online

### A Few Basics
I am [Matthew Mortensen](http://www.matthewmortensen.com), entrepreneur and aspiring community leader, based in Las Vegas, NV. I specialize in customer relations management. I recently started contributing to personal, and orginizational github repositories. I am learning slowly and enjoy how [GitHub](http://www.github.com) offers teaching, education and allows for the application of open source coding through the use of their software.
###  Programming
I am getting ever so slightly acclimented to open source coding. I am a [Mozilla](https://mozillians.org/en-US/u/happygoldlucky/) Developer Network contributor; however, being extremely new is making it difficult to find the best places to contribute.
